   For my logo design, I wanted the image to carry elements that are iconographically associated with Maine while still speaking to the planetarium’s connection to the night sky. I chose a crescent moon as the main shape, since it instantly evokes stargazing and curiosity. Inside the curve, I placed symbols from Maine’s flag, the pine tree and star. The tree grounds the design in the local landscape, while the star suggests guidance and exploration. Together, these elements create a logo that feels both rooted in place and open to the vastness of the universe.

     I chose to create my utopia based on some peaceful elements that bring me comfort. Recently, I’ve been falling asleep to YouTube videos of a woman playing harp in nature. I found one in particular where a deer wanders into the frame. That unexpected harmony between music and wildlife inspired the sensory foundation of my dreamscape.

From there, I envisioned a scene that feels like a hidden, magical pocket of the world, one you stumble upon during a quiet journey. Bunnies are one of my favorite animals, so I centered them in the composition to evoke a sense of gentleness and serenity. I placed the rabbits in various positions to create a more lived-in and believable environment, as if they were truly at home, playing in a field of clover. Each element— nature, animals, sound, texture, stillness— was chosen to create a sense of calm, warmth, and quiet wonder.

One playful detail I created was a wooden sign that reads, “Bunny Sanctuary – Welcome, Travelers! Free Carrots.” It’s meant to add a touch of whimsy and make the viewer feel invited and cared for, as if they’ve found a refuge not just for animals, but for themselves too. The animals are not just living here, but caring for their land and their guests.

Learning how to create this image was a challenge for me, especially since working digitally isn’t my usual medium. As a result, I focused on just one composition for now. I wanted to make sure the scene felt intentional and complete, as I was still figuring out the tools and process along the way.

    I wanted this piece to feel like flipping through someone’s dream journal, watching different aspirations throughout a life, and stopping at a crossroads the protagonist once faced. My idea began with a search for an interesting audio that could be separated from the footage to convey a story through gestures, light, and an internal space, rather than dialogue. I pulled older film and educational footage from <em>The Lamp of Memory</em>, along with <em>Design for Dreaming</em>, <em>That Junior Miss Spirit</em>, <em>How the Eye Functions</em>, <em>American Choice Outtakes Reel 6</em>, and <em>The Growth of Plants</em>. I was drawn to the grain, flicker, and unpredictable color shifts that make these images feel like memories rather than records.
</br>
</br>
    In the edit, I used loops and fades to white and black. White fades signify softer, kinder dreams; black fades act like blinks or the turning of a journal page. I avoided altering the speed of footage and tried to keep some moments where the film aligns with its true audio while leaning into repetition to let certain movements echo. Petals drift, a white dress turns in the breeze, wind stirs the scene, and light spills across the frame; these recurring moments lead the viewer through shifting perspectives, tying her movements to the world around her. The project asks how joy moves through us and whether memory can be held in movement. For now, I hope it reads like an innate permission to enjoy your own company.

This project is a 3D recreation of my favorite spoon, rendered to look as close to the original as possible. The object has a distinctive shape: the handle widens drastically where it rests between the finger joints, the mouthpiece is nicely circular, and an embellishment anchors the bottom. Specific details, such as the line that runs around the handle and into the embellishment, required particular attention. If not done correctly, these elements would either stand out too firmly or fade away, and additional rendering was necessary to achieve the right dimensional balance.

The work explores the idea of permanence. In a world where metal utensils have lost their flair and plastic is everywhere, this spoon represents a product that has endured the test of time. Its origin is unknown, and I've never encountered another like it. This sense of mystery and longevity is what inspired the project, transforming an ordinary utensil into a subject of tribute and preservation.
